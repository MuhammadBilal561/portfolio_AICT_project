Exited to announce the completion of my AICT project of first semester. This is a basic Portfolio webiste made by a group of 4 people. We use Html 5 fir the structuring of the website 
and CSS 3 For the Styling of the website in which main components are flex, grid and transition properties. We also use basic Javascriptto get the contact form enteries.The weakness of
this project is that it is just a frontend there is no backend or database to store the contact form enteries. But iam very hopeful to learn the databases concept in the next semester
and implement in this project. I also thank my professor @AliyaFarooq for the wonderfull guiding during the project
